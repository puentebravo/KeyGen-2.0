## Installation

Navigate to the deployed URL, then follow your devices' process to install a webapp.

## Usage

Simply enter the desired length of your password, and tap the Generate button. A phrase containing numbers, letters, and symbols will appear in moments. We highly recommend using a password vault to save the result.
